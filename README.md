# JUCE_BareMinimumOpenGL
Bare minimum OpenGL. Sometime's all you want is a window with a menu and an OpenGL context that responds to mouse input.

This Project does just that. It's up to you to layer shaders, textures and object loading but all the fiddly stuff of getting a triangle on screen is done.
